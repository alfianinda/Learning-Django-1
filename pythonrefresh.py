### variable 

# age = 17
# name = "Inna"

# print(age)
# print("Hello my name is {}. I am {} years old from Mars".format(name, age))

### exercise 
# I have given you two variables, name and age. Use the format() function to create a sentence that reads:
# Hi my name is Julie and I am 42 years old
# Set that equal to the variable called sentence

# name = "Julie"
# age = 42
# sentence = "Hi my name is {} and I am {} years old".format(name, age)
# print(sentence)

### if statements and comments

# if age > 18: 
#     print("You are older than 18")
#     print("This is another line")
# else:
